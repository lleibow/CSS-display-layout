## Step One: Creating / Initializing a git repo

1. Move to your code directory
2. Create a new directory
3. Move into it
4. Create an empty file called "hello.rb"
5. Open the directory you're in with sublime text via the command line
6. Inside the "hello.rb" file, write a Ruby statement that outputs "Good morning". Save your file.
7. Initialize (Create) your git repository
8. Check your current status and read carefully what it says
9. Start tracking / Add the "hello.rb" file to the repository (be specific)
10. Check your current status and read carefully what it says
11. Create your first commit with a message
12. Check your current status and read carefully what it says

(BONUS) Check your repository log

If you're done before, go to alexa.bitmaker.co and update your GitHub profile info. 
If you're bored, delete your directory and do it all over again. Practice is key here!

## Remote repositories

There are two ways to set up repository on GitHub:

1. Using an existing local repository and then creating it on GitHub
2. Creating an empty repository on github first and then cloning it locally

## Step Two: Using an existing local repository and then creating it on GitHub

1. Create a GitHub repository for the project (on the GitHub website)
2. In your local version, set up the remote repository as "origin". (Follow the instructions on your github page)
3. Check your repository's status, get in the habit of reading
4. Push your project to GitHub
5. Refresh the GitHub page and see your changes have been uploaded to your remote repository
6. Make changes to your "hello.rb" file
7. Check the repo's status
8. Stage your changes
9. Check the repo's status
10. Create a new commit with a meaningful message
11. Check your repo's status
12. Push the code to GitHub (origin)
13. Refresh the github page and see your changes have been uploaded to your remote repository

(BONUS) 
If you're done: 

1. Delete the GitHub repo you just created 
2. Look up how to "unset a remote repository" 
3. Start all over again!

## Step Three: Creating an empty repository on github first and then cloning it locally

1. Create a new GitHub repository. Name it whatever you like.
2. Find the clone url (git@...) on the page. You can use https if you haven't yet setup your SSH keys (but you should!)
3. Clone the repository
4. Move into the directory
5. Create a new directory inside your project
6. Check the status of the repo - why can't you see the directory you just created?
7. Move into the new directory and create a new empty file called "joke.rb"
8. Open the file with Atom and have it output "Why did the chicken cross the road?". Save it!
9. Check your repo's status - what's different ?
10. Stage your changes
11. Check the repo's status
12. Create a new commit with a meaningful message
13. Push the code to GitHub (origin)
14. Refresh the GitHub page and see your changes have been uploaded to your remote repository

(BONUS) 

1. Move back to your repository's top 
2. Print out the current directory 
3. List out all the files in your directory 
4. Remove the hidden git directory 
5. What happens if you try to check the git status?

## Step Four: Collaboration

1. Pick a buddy
2. Ask your buddy to add you as a collaborator to his/her project
3. Clone the repo (git@git...)
4. Move into the directory
5. Change a file
6. Check status
7. Stage your change
8. Check status
9. Create a commit with a meaningful message
10. Push your changes to the remote repository
11. Move to your project that you shared with your buddy
12. Pull the changes he/she made to your repo
